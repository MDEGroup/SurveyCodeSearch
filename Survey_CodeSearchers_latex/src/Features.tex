Considering all these information, we can list several features that should be taken into consideration and implemented during the development of a recommendation system based on retrieving source code. The key features are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The query mechanism;
\item  The similarity criteria;
\item  How it indexes the data (if present);
\item The post-ranking process (if present);
\item The source of the recommended snippets (S0,Github);
\item The tool interoperability support  (plugin,Web client);
\item The supported languages;
\item Tool availability;
\item Validation framework of results

\end{itemize}
Of course, this list is only a small part of possible features but we have focused on this subset to perform a more complete and qualitative investigation on them.
